# An Homage to Hans

The visualisation can be viewed at https://lkillora.github.io/.

It is an homage to Hans Rosling, who gave the ted talk "The Best Stats You've Ever Seen", which can be viewed at https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?language=en.

This visualisation allows the user many functionalities; one being to select a country or two. 
As a result the bubbles representing all other countries will become more transparent. 
The labels for the selected countries will pop up to be large and visible.
The radar plot will graph how both countries fare in the various pillars of
competitiveness, animating the changes too; most notably by expanding them up from small polygons.
The bubble plot will track the path of the two countries, and the labels will always stay in front of the bubbles.

The user can then select a new year to view and the visualisation will animate the transition.
Or hit the "Play" button to animate through 20 years (looping from 2017 to 2007), unless they hit the "Stop" button. 
The "Reset" button can also stop the playthrough, but it will concomitantly reset all the selections and dropdown menus too.
The display year will change with the animations or selections.

When the user hovers their mouse over the bubbles, they will change colour 
and display the nation they represent.
The "Select Country" dropdown menu options are populated from an Excel CSV file.
The radar legend dynamically appears and resizes to the selections.
The coloured world map was made in Microsoft Paint by using a originally-blank map.
The x axis is scaled logarithmically.
The data comes from one Excel CSV file.
