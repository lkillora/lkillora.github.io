An Homage to Hans
The visualisation can be viewed at https://lkillora.github.io/.

It allows the user many functionalities; one being to select a country or two. 
This will make the bubbles representing all other countries more transparent. 
The labels for the selected countries will pop up to be large and visible.
The radar plot will graph how both countries fare in the various pillars of
competitiveness, and it animates the selections too, expanding up from small polygons.
The bubble plot will track the path of the two countries.
The labels will always stay in front of the bubbles.

The user can then select a new year to view and the visualisation will animate the transition.
Or hitting the "Play" button will animate through 20 years (looping from 2017 to 2007)
unless one hits the "Stop" button. 
The "Reset" button can also stop it, but it will also reset all selections and dropdowns too.
The display year will change with the animations or selections.

When the user hovers their mouse over the bubbles, the bubble will change colour 
and display the nation that it represents.
The "Select Country" dropdown menu options are populated from an Excel CSV file.
The radar legend dynamically appears and resizes to the selections.
The coloured world map was made in Microsoft Paint by using a originally-blank map.
The x axis is scaled logarithmically.
The data comes from one Excel CSV file.
